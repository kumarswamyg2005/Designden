# Wishlist Auto-Remove After Order Placement - COMPLETE

## ✅ Issue Fixed: Wishlist Items Not Removed After Ordering

### Problem

When customers placed orders from their wishlist, the items remained in the wishlist even after the order was successfully placed. This caused confusion and clutter.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Direct Order from Wishlist (POST /place-order)

When a customer clicks "Order Item" directly from the wishlist:

- System checks if the design is a wishlist item (`design.wishlist === true`)
- After order is successfully created, the wishlist item is automatically deleted
- Customer's wishlist is updated in real-time

**Code Location**: `routes/customer.js` - Line ~348-395

```javascript
// After order is saved
if (design.wishlist === true) {
  await Design.deleteOne({ _id: design._id });
  console.log("[PLACE-ORDER] Removed wishlist item after order:", design._id);
}
```

#### 2. Add to Cart Then Checkout (POST /process-checkout)

When a customer adds wishlist items to cart, then checks out:

- Added `designId` field to Customization model to track original design
- When creating customization from design, store the original `designId`
- During checkout, populate the `designId` to check if it's a wishlist item
- After order is placed, batch delete all wishlist items that were ordered
- Supports multiple wishlist items in one order

**Code Location**:

- Model: `models/customization.js` - Added `designId` field
- Add to cart: `routes/customer.js` - Line ~640
- Checkout: `routes/customer.js` - Line ~893-1020

```javascript
// During checkout, collect wishlist design IDs
const wishlistDesignIds = [];
for (const item of cartItems) {
  if (
    item.customizationId.designId &&
    item.customizationId.designId.wishlist === true
  ) {
    wishlistDesignIds.push(item.customizationId.designId._id);
  }
}

// Batch delete wishlist items after order
if (wishlistDesignIds.length > 0) {
  await Design.deleteMany({
    _id: { $in: wishlistDesignIds },
    customerId: req.session.user.id,
    wishlist: true,
  });
  console.log("[CHECKOUT] Removed", wishlistDesignIds.length, "wishlist items");
}
```

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Customization Model (`models/customization.js`)

**Added Field**:

```javascript
designId: {
  type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  ref: "Design",
  // Optional: track original design (including wishlist items) for cleanup
}
```

**Purpose**: Track which design (including wishlist items) was used to create the customization, enabling cleanup after order placement.

### 2. Add to Cart Route (`routes/customer.js`)

**Before**:

```javascript
const customization = new Customization({
  userId: userId,
  fabricId: defaultFabric._id,
  customText: design.additionalNotes || "Custom Design",
  // ... other fields
});
```

**After**:

```javascript
const customization = new Customization({
  userId: userId,
  fabricId: defaultFabric._id,
  designId: design._id, // ← Track original design
  customText: design.additionalNotes || "Custom Design",
  // ... other fields
});

console.log(
  "[ADD-TO-CART] Created customization from design:",
  design._id,
  "Wishlist:",
  design.wishlist
);
```

### 3. Place Order Route (`routes/customer.js`)

**Added**: Automatic wishlist removal after direct order

```javascript
// After order.save()
if (design.wishlist === true) {
  await Design.deleteOne({ _id: design._id });
  console.log("[PLACE-ORDER] Removed wishlist item after order:", design._id);
}
```

### 4. Checkout Route (`routes/customer.js`)

**Updated Cart Population**:

```javascript
// OLD: Only populate customization
const cart = await Cart.findOne({ userId: req.session.user.id }).populate({
  path: "items.customizationId",
  model: "Customization",
});

// NEW: Populate customization AND nested design
const cart = await Cart.findOne({ userId: req.session.user.id }).populate({
  path: "items.customizationId",
  model: "Customization",
  populate: {
    path: "designId", // ← Nested populate
    model: "Design",
  },
});
```

**Added**: Batch wishlist cleanup after checkout

```javascript
// After order is saved, before clearing cart
const wishlistDesignIds = [];
for (const item of cartItems) {
  if (
    item.customizationId.designId &&
    item.customizationId.designId.wishlist === true
  ) {
    wishlistDesignIds.push(item.customizationId.designId._id);
  }
}

if (wishlistDesignIds.length > 0) {
  await Design.deleteMany({
    _id: { $in: wishlistDesignIds },
    customerId: req.session.user.id,
    wishlist: true,
  });
  console.log(
    "[CHECKOUT] Removed",
    wishlistDesignIds.length,
    "wishlist items after order"
  );
}
```

## Database Impact

### Before Fix

```javascript
// Customer's wishlist
[
  { _id: '60a1b2c3...', name: 'Design 1', wishlist: true },
  { _id: '60a1b2c4...', name: 'Design 2', wishlist: true },
]

// After ordering Design 1 → NO CHANGE (bug)
[
  { _id: '60a1b2c3...', name: 'Design 1', wishlist: true }, // ❌ Still there
  { _id: '60a1b2c4...', name: 'Design 2', wishlist: true },
]
```

### After Fix

```javascript
// Customer's wishlist
[
  { _id: '60a1b2c3...', name: 'Design 1', wishlist: true },
  { _id: '60a1b2c4...', name: 'Design 2', wishlist: true },
]

// After ordering Design 1 → REMOVED (fixed)
[
  { _id: '60a1b2c4...', name: 'Design 2', wishlist: true }, // ✅ Only this remains
]
```

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Better UX**: Wishlist stays clean and relevant
2. ✅ **No Confusion**: Customers don't see "already ordered" items
3. ✅ **Automatic**: No manual removal needed
4. ✅ **Works Both Ways**: Direct order AND cart checkout
5. ✅ **Batch Efficient**: Multiple items deleted in one query
6. ✅ **Backwards Compatible**: Existing non-wishlist designs unaffected
7. ✅ **Logging**: Clear console messages for debugging

## Edge Cases Handled

### ✅ Non-Wishlist Designs

- Regular designs don't have `wishlist: true` flag
- No deletion attempted
- Normal order flow continues

### ✅ Wishlist Item Not Found

- If design already deleted (race condition)
- `deleteOne` and `deleteMany` handle gracefully
- No errors thrown

### ✅ Mixed Orders

- Some items are wishlist, some are not
- Only wishlist items deleted
- Shop products remain unaffected

### ✅ Empty Wishlist

- `wishlistDesignIds` array is empty
- `deleteMany` not called (performance optimization)
- No unnecessary database queries

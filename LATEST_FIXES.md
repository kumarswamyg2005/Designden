# Final Session 2 Fixes - Complete âœ…

## All Issues Resolved

### 1. âœ… Order Details Page Fixed

**Problem**: Page crashed with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'productImage')"

**Solution**: Completely rewrote `order-details.ejs` to work with new Order schema that uses `items` array instead of single `designId`

**Now displays**:

- âœ… All items in order with customization details
- âœ… Quantity and price for each item
- âœ… Total order price
- âœ… Order status and timeline
- âœ… Delivery address

---

### 2. âœ… Add to Cart - Not Logged In Issue

**Problem**: Non-logged-in users could click "Add to Cart" but would just get redirected to login without understanding why

**Solution**: Updated product details page to show different buttons based on login state:

- **Logged in**: "Add to Cart" button (functional)
- **Not logged in**: "Login to Add to Cart" button (clear action needed)

---

### 3. âœ… Server Running from Wrong Directory

**Problem**: User tried to run `node app.js` from `/views/customer/` directory

**Solution**: Server must always run from project root:

```bash
cd /Users/kumaraswamy/Desktop/design-den-main
node app.js
```

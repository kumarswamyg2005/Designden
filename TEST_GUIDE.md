## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If Manager Assignment Fails:

1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Verify designer@designden.com exists:
   ```bash
   node scripts/ensure-single-designer.js
   ```
3. Check server logs for error messages
4. Error should now show: "Failed to assign designer: [reason]"

### If Shop Orders Don't Auto-Approve:

1. Check if product has `productId` in customization
2. Check server logs for "[CHECKOUT]" messages

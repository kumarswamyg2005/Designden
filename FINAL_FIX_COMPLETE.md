# FINAL FIX - place-order.ejs EJS Syntax Error ✅

## Problem

**Error**: `SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'price'` when trying to load place-order page from wishlist

**Root Cause**: Line 160 in place-order.ejs had:

```javascript
const actualDesignPrice = <%= design.price ?design.price: 'null' %>;
```

The ternary operator had **NO SPACES** which was confusing the EJS compiler. Also using `<%=` instead of `<%-` was HTML-escaping the output.

## Solution

Changed line 160 from:

```ejs
const actualDesignPrice = <%= design.price ?design.price: 'null' %>;
```

To:

```ejs
const actualDesignPrice = <%- design.price ? design.price : 'null' %>;
```

**Changes**:

1. ✅ Added spaces around `?` and `:` operators
2. ✅ Changed `<%=` to `<%-` to prevent HTML escaping of JavaScript values

## Additional Fix

Also fixed the order details route which was trying to populate the old `designId` field:

**Before**:

```javascript
const order = await Order.findById(req.params.orderId)
  .populate({
    path: "designId", // ❌ This field doesn't exist
    populate: {
      path: "productId",
      model: "Product",
    },
  })
  .populate("designerId", "username email");
```

**After**:

```javascript
const order = await Order.findById(req.params.orderId).populate({
  path: "items.customizationId", // ✅ Correct field
  model: "Customization",
});
```

### ✅ Test 2: View Order Details

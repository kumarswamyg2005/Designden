## Expected Console Output:

```bash
POST /designer/order/68eb52228eea336e58066c71/mark-shipped 200 10ms
[AUTO-DELIVERY] Order 68eb52228eea336e58066c71 will be auto-delivered in 5 seconds...

# ... 5 seconds pass ...

[AUTO-DELIVERY] ✅ Order 68eb52228eea336e58066c71 automatically marked as delivered
```

## 🐛 If Auto-Delivery Doesn't Work

### Check 1: Server Running?

```bash
lsof -ti:3000
# Should return a process ID
```

### Check 2: Watch Server Console

Make sure you're looking at the terminal where `node app.js` is running

### Check 3: Order Still "Shipped"?

If order gets cancelled or changed before 5 seconds, auto-delivery won't trigger

### Check 4: Check Database

```javascript
db.orders.findOne({ _id: ObjectId("68eb52228eea336e58066c71") });
// Check: status should be "delivered" after 5 seconds
// Check: deliveredAt should have a timestamp
```

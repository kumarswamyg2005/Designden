## 📝 Notes

**Important:** Designers ONLY work on custom 3D designs created by customers in the Design Studio. Shop product orders are automatically processed and don't require designer intervention. This creates a clear workflow:

- **Shop Orders:** Customer → Manager → Production → Shipping
- **Custom Orders:** Customer → Manager → **Designer** → Production → Shipping

This ensures designers focus on creative custom work while shop orders are handled efficiently!

**Ready for production use! 🎉**

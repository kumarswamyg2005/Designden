- Use pre-recorded screenshots as backup

**If shop filtering fails:**

- Check server is running
- Check Network tab for error status
- Explain from code instead

**If Network tab doesn't show requests:**

- Ensure "Fetch/XHR" filter is selected
- Try clicking "Preserve log"
- Clear and retry

**If cart doesn't work:**

- Ensure logged in
- Check product exists
- Show code endpoint instead

## 📝 TIPS FOR SMOOTH RECORDING

1. **Practice 3 times** before final recording
2. **Speak slowly and clearly** - not too fast
3. **Use mouse to point** at important elements
4. **Pause briefly** after actions to show results
5. **Don't say "um" or "uh"** - pause silently instead
6. **Have water nearby** for dry mouth
7. **Record in quiet room** with no background noise
8. **Use a timer** to stay on track (set 7:30 alarm)
9. **If you mess up** - just restart that section
10. **Be confident** - you built this!

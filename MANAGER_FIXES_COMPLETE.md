# Manager Assignment Fix & Shop Order Auto-Approval

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Manager Unable to Assign Designer

**Problem**: Manager dashboard assignment button wasn't working
**Root Cause**: JavaScript was checking `res.ok` but backend returned `{ ok: true }` in JSON
**Solution**: Updated JavaScript to parse JSON response and check `data.ok`

**File Changed**: `views/manager/dashboard.ejs`

```javascript
// OLD CODE (didn't work):
if (res.ok) {
  alert("Designer assigned successfully!");
  location.reload();
}

// NEW CODE (works):
const data = await res.json();
if (res.ok && data.ok) {
  alert("Designer assigned successfully!");
  location.reload();
} else {
  alert("Failed to assign designer: " + (data.error || "Unknown error"));
}
```

### 2. ✅ Shop Orders Auto-Approved (No Assignment Needed)

**Problem**: Shop/ready-made products required manual assignment
**Solution**: Shop orders now automatically move to "in_production" status

**How It Works**:

- **Custom Design Orders** (created in Design Studio):

  - Have NO `productId` in customization
  - Status: `pending` → require manager to assign designer
  - Show "Custom Design" badge in manager dashboard
  - Manager must assign to `designer@designden.com`

- **Shop Orders** (ready-made products):
  - Have `productId` in customization
  - Status: Automatically set to `in_production`
  - Show "Shop Order" badge with "Auto-Approved" indicator
  - NO designer assignment needed
  - Customer receives immediate confirmation

**Files Changed**:

1. `routes/customer.js` - Auto-approval logic
2. `views/manager/dashboard.ejs` - Visual distinction between order types

## Manager Dashboard Updates

### New "Type" Column

Shows order classification:

- 🎨 **Custom Design** (blue badge) - Needs designer assignment
- 🛍️ **Shop Order** (green badge) - Auto-approved

### Smart Actions Column

- **Custom Orders**: Show "Assign Designer" button
- **Shop Orders**: Show "Auto-Approved" badge (no action needed)

## Complete Order Flow

### Shop Orders (Ready-Made Products):

```
Customer Places Order
    ↓
✅ AUTO-APPROVED to "in_production"
    ↓
Production/Shipping (handled by shop)
    ↓

```

**Timeline Entry**: "Shop order auto-approved and moved to production"
**Notification**: "Order Confirmed & In Production!"

### Custom Design Orders (3D Studio):

```
Customer Places Order
    ↓
Status: "pending"
    ↓
Manager Assigns to designer@designden.com
    ↓

## Technical Details

### Customer Checkout Logic (`routes/customer.js`):

```javascript
// Check if order contains shop products (has productId) or custom designs
let isShopOrder = true;
for (const item of cartItems) {
  if (!item.customizationId.productId) {
    isShopOrder = false; // Custom design found
  }
}

// Set status based on order type
const orderStatus = isShopOrder ? "in_production" : "pending";

// Add timeline for shop orders
if (isShopOrder) {
  order.timeline = [
    {
      status: "in_production",
      note: "Shop order auto-approved and moved to production",
      at: new Date(),
    },
  ];

  // Set production start time
  order.productionStartedAt = new Date();

  // Send confirmation notification
  await Notification.create({
    userId: customerId,
    title: "Order Confirmed & In Production!",
    message: `Your shop order #${orderId} has been confirmed and is now being prepared.`,
  });
}
```

### Manager Dashboard Logic (`views/manager/dashboard.ejs`):

```javascript
// Check if order is custom design
const isCustomOrder =
  order.items &&
  order.items.some(
    (item) => item.customizationId && !item.customizationId.productId
  );

// Show appropriate actions
if (isCustomOrder) {
  // Show "Assign Designer" button
} else {
  // Show "Auto-Approved" badge
}
```

## Testing

1. Login as customer
2. Go to Shop page
3. Select a ready-made product (T-shirt, Hoodie, etc.)
4. Add to cart and checkout
5. ✅ Order should automatically be "in_production"
6. ✅ No assignment needed in manager dashboard
7. ✅ Customer receives confirmation notification

### Test Custom Design Order:

1. Login as customer
2. Go to Design Studio
3. Create custom 3D design
4. Add to cart and checkout

## Error Handling

### Assignment Errors Now Show Details:

```javascript
alert("Failed to assign designer: " + (data.error || "Unknown error"));
console.error("Assignment error:", data);
```

### Backend Validation:

- Only `designer@designden.com` can be assigned
- Returns error if trying to assign to non-existent designer
- Returns 403 if trying to assign to wrong account

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Faster Processing**: Shop orders don't wait for assignment
2. ✅ **Better UX**: Customers get immediate confirmation for shop orders
3. ✅ **Clear Distinction**: Manager sees exactly which orders need attention
4. ✅ **Designer Focus**: Designer only works on custom 3D designs
5. ✅ **Error Feedback**: Manager sees detailed error messages if assignment fails

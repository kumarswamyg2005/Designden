## ‚úÖ Task 3: Auto-Approve Shop Orders

### **What Was Done:**

1. **Model Enhancement** (`models/customization.js`)

   - Added `productId` field to Customization schema
   - `productId` present = Shop order (pre-made product)
   - `productId` null = Custom design order

2. **Add-to-Cart Enhancement** (`routes/customer.js`)

   - Updated shop product add-to-cart to include `productId`
   - Maintains distinction between shop and custom orders
   - All shop orders now tagged with product reference

3. **Checkout Logic Update** (`routes/customer.js`)
   - Added shop order detection in `process-checkout` route
   - Checks all cart items for `productId` field
   - **Shop Orders:** Auto-set status to `"in_production"` (skip pending approval)
   - **Custom Orders:** Status remains `"pending"` (requires manager approval)
   - Mixed orders treated as custom (requires approval for safety)

### **Logic Flow:**

```javascript
// During checkout:
for each item in cart:
  if item has no productId:
    isShopOrder = false  // Custom design detected

if isShopOrder:
  order.status = "in_production"  // Auto-approved
else:
  order.status = "pending"  // Needs approval
```

### **Benefits:**

- ‚úÖ Shop orders bypass manual approval (faster processing)
- ‚úÖ Custom designs still require manager review (quality control)
- ‚úÖ Clear separation between order types
- ‚úÖ Automatic workflow optimization

### **Files Modified:**

- ‚úÖ `models/customization.js` - Added productId field
- ‚úÖ `routes/customer.js` - Updated add-to-cart and checkout logic

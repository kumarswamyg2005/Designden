# Issues Fixed - Session 2

## Summary of All Fixes

### Issue 1: Shop items not adding to cart + Cart showing wrong count âœ…

**Problems:**

- Shop add-to-cart route was doing nothing (just redirecting back)
- Cart badge showing "1" when cart is empty
- Cart count using old CartItem.countDocuments() logic

**Fixes:**

1. **routes/shop.js** - Implemented proper add-to-cart:

   - Creates Customization from product
   - Finds or creates Cart for user
   - Adds item to cart.items array
   - Checks stock before adding (inStock && stockQuantity > 0)
   - Redirects to /customer/cart

2. **app.js** - Fixed cart count middleware:

   - Changed from `CartItem.countDocuments()` to `Cart.findOne()`
   - Counts items in cart.items array: `cart.items.length`
   - Returns 0 if no cart exists

3. **views/customer/cart.ejs** - Updated to use Customization:
   - Changed all `item.designId` references to `item.customizationId`
   - Updated remove/update forms to use `customizationId` instead of `cartItemId`
   - Fixed price calculations to use `customizationId.price`

### Issue 2: Wishlist not showing 3D model âœ…

**Problem:**

- Wishlist items only showed static category images
- No 3D preview/indication

**Fix:**

- **views/customer/dashboard.ejs** - Enhanced wishlist cards:
  - Added 3D preview container div with cube icon overlay
  - Shows "3D Preview" badge on hover
  - Note: Full 3D rendering requires Three.js integration (can be added later)

### Issue 3: EJS syntax error in place-order.ejs âœ…

**Problems:**

- EJS compilation error: "Unexpected token '{'"
- Inline JavaScript inside EJS tags was malformed
- "Use & Order" button should say "Order Item"

**Fixes:**

1. **views/customer/place-order.ejs** - Fixed EJS syntax:

   ```javascript
   // BEFORE (broken):
   <% // VALIDATION: Ensure we have the actual design price const actualDesignPrice=design.price; if (!actualDesignPrice || actualDesignPrice <=0) { console.error... %>

   // AFTER (fixed):
   <%
     // VALIDATION: Ensure we have the actual design price
     const actualDesignPrice = design.price;
     if (!actualDesignPrice || actualDesignPrice <= 0) {
       console.error('ðŸš¨ RULE 4 VIOLATION...');
     }
   %>
   ```

   - Properly formatted multi-line JavaScript in EJS tags
   - Fixed spacing and line breaks

2. **views/customer/dashboard.ejs** - Changed button text:
   - "Use & Order" â†’ "Order Item"
   - Updated href to `/customer/place-order/${d._id}`

### Issue 4: Admin dashboard needs redesign (TODO)

**Requirements from screenshots:**

- Show earnings/revenue metrics
- Display sales analytics charts
- Product performance stats
- Remove product assignment functionality

**Status:** Ready for implementation in next phase

### Issue 5: Manager dashboard needs redesign (TODO)

**Requirements from screenshots:**

- Assign custom 3D designs to designers
- Control product stock/inventory
- View pending design requests

**Status:** Ready for implementation in next phase

### Issue 6: Auto-approve shop orders + stock validation âœ… (Partially)

**Stock Validation - DONE:**

- Product model has `inStock` boolean and `stockQuantity` number
- Shop add-to-cart checks stock before adding
- Product details page shows stock status
- Out of stock products cannot be ordered

**Auto-approve ready-made orders - TODO:**

- Need to update order creation logic
- Shop orders should skip manager approval
- Custom design orders still need manager â†’ designer workflow

## Next Steps

### Immediate Testing

1. **Test shop add-to-cart:**

   ```
   - Go to /shop
   - Click on a product
   - Select size and color
   - Click "Add to Cart"
   - Should redirect to cart with item showing

   ```

2. **Test wishlist order:**

   ```
   - Go to Design Studio
   - Configure a design
   - Click "Add to Wishlist"
   - Go to Dashboard
   - See wishlist item with 3D preview indicator
   - Click "Order Item"
   - Should go to place-order page
   ```

3. **Test stock validation:**
   ```
   - Update a product stockQuantity to 0 in database
   - Try to add to cart - should fail
   - Product page should show "Out of Stock"
   ```

### Still TODO

1. **Admin Dashboard Redesign:**

   - Create analytics dashboard with charts
   - Show earnings metrics
   - Display product performance
   - Remove assignment features

2. **Manager Dashboard Redesign:**

   - Create design assignment interface
   - Add inventory management
   - Show pending custom orders

3. **Auto-approve Shop Orders:**

   - Update order creation to check if from shop
   - Skip manager approval for ready-made products

   - Load Three.js in wishlist
   - Render actual 3D models
   - Add rotate/zoom controls

## Database Notes

### Cart Structure (Updated)

```javascript
{
  userId: ObjectId,
  items: [
    {
      customizationId: ObjectId, // References Customization
      quantity: Number,
      addedAt: Date
    }
  ]
}
```

### Product Schema (Stock Fields)

```javascript
{
  inStock: Boolean, // Quick flag
  stockQuantity: Number, // Actual count
  // ...other fields
}
```

## Known Issues

1. **Cart view might show broken images** - Customization.customImage might be null for some items
2. **3D preview is static** - Need Three.js integration for actual 3D rendering
3. **No stock decrement** - When order is placed, stock isn't reduced (needs implementation)
4. **Shop orders still need approval** - Auto-approval logic not yet implemented

# Single Designer Setup - Complete

## Overview

The system has been configured to work with **only ONE designer account**: `designer@designden.com`

## What Was Done

### 1. Database Cleanup ✅

- **Script Created**: `scripts/ensure-single-designer.js`
- **Action Taken**: Removed 5 other designer accounts from database
- **Result**: Only `designer@designden.com` remains in the system
- **Designer ID**: `68eaacd23610d4d3362485d1`

### 2. Manager Assignment Enhanced ✅

**File**: `routes/manager.js`

- Manager can **only assign orders to designer@designden.com**
- Validation added to prevent assignment to any other account
- Auto-creates "assigned" status when manager assigns order
- Notifications sent to both designer and customer

### 3. Order Status Flow Enhanced ✅

**New Status**: `assigned` - Added to Order model
**Complete Workflow**:

1. **Pending** → Order placed by customer
2. **Assigned** → Manager assigns to designer@designden.com
3. **In Production** → Designer accepts and starts work
4. **Completed** → Designer finishes the design work
5. **Shipped** → Designer marks as shipped with tracking
6. **Delivered** → Final delivery confirmation

### 4. Designer Workflow Updates ✅

#### Routes (`routes/designer.js`):

**Accept Order** - POST `/designer/order/:orderId/accept`

- Changes status: `assigned` → `in_production`
- Records `productionStartedAt` timestamp
- Notifies customer: "🎨 Designer Started Working on Your Order!"
- Timeline updated with acceptance note

**Update Progress** - POST `/designer/order/:orderId/update-progress`

- Allows designer to update progress (0-100%)
- Adds notes to timeline
- Sends progress notifications with emojis:
  - 🔨 for 0-49%
  - ⚡ for 50-74%
  - 🎉 for 75-100%
- Customer receives: "Progress Update: X% Complete"

**Mark as Completed** - POST `/designer/order/:orderId/mark-ready`

- Changes status: `in_production` → `completed`
- Records `productionCompletedAt` timestamp
- Notifies customer: "🎊 Your Custom Design is Complete!"
- Ready for shipping

**Mark as Shipped** - POST `/designer/order/:orderId/mark-shipped` (NEW)

- Changes status: `completed` → `shipped`
- Records `shippedAt` timestamp
- Optional tracking information
- Notifies customer: "📦 Your Order Has Been Shipped!"

### 5. Designer Dashboard Updates ✅

**File**: `views/designer/dashboard.ejs`

- Statistics include "assigned" status in pending count
- Status badges show all workflow states:
  - 🕐 Pending (yellow)
  - ✓ Assigned (blue)
  - ⚙️ In Production (primary blue)
  - ✓✓ Completed (green)
  - 📦 Shipped (dark)

### 6. Designer Order Details Page ✅

**File**: `views/designer/order-details.ejs`

**Action Buttons by Status**:

- **In Production**:
  - "Update Progress" button (opens modal with percentage slider)
  - "Mark as Completed" button

- **Shipped/Delivered**: Success message display

**Modals Added**:

1. **Progress Update Modal**: Slider (0-100%) + notes textarea
2. **Mark Completed Modal**: Completion notes textarea
3. **Mark Shipped Modal**: Tracking information textarea (optional)

**Customer Notifications**: Sent at every status change with detailed messages

## How It Works

### For Manager:

1. Login as manager (`manager@designden.com`)
2. View pending custom design orders
3. Click "Assign" button on an order
4. Select "designer@designden.com" from dropdown (only option)
5. Designer and customer both notified

### For Designer (designer@designden.com):

1. Login at `/designer/login` or `/designer/direct`
2. Dashboard shows only custom 3D design orders (not shop products)
3. View assigned orders with "Assigned" status
4. Click "View & Work" on any order
5. **Accept Order**: Starts work (status → in_production)
6. **Update Progress**: Update percentage + notes (customer notified)
7. **Mark as Completed**: Design work done (status → completed)
8. **Mark as Shipped**: Package sent (status → shipped, customer notified)

### For Customer:

- Receives notifications at each step:
  - When order assigned to designer
  - When designer accepts and starts work
  - On every progress update (with percentage)
  - When design is completed
  - When order is shipped (with tracking)
- Can view order status in their dashboard
- Timeline shows all status changes with timestamps

## Database Schema Updates

### Order Model (`models/order.js`):

```javascript
status: {
  type: String,
  enum: [
    "pending",
    "assigned",      // NEW
    "in_production",
    "completed",
    "shipped",
    "delivered",
    "cancelled",
  ],
  default: "pending",
}
```
